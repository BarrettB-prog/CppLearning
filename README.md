While a significant portion of these files were uploaded all around the same time, they were the cumulation of ~6 months worth of learning. The remainder were all uploaded in real-time.

Some of these are homework assignments due for classes, while others are in-class activities, and the rest are my personal notes or test files to help me understand how certain things work.

This code is not intended for production purposes, it is simply used to track my learning and progress.
